![Project Overview](insurance_data_analysis_Image.jpg)


### **Project Description:**

This project focuses on analyzing insurance data to understand the key factors influencing insurance charges and customer demographics. The dataset contains detailed information on customers, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, and geographical region.

By exploring these variables, we aim to:

- Uncover patterns and trends that affect insurance charges.
- Provide insights to help insurance companies refine their pricing strategies.
- Gain a deeper understanding of customer demographics and risk factors.

### **Objectives:**

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Manage missing values and identify any outliers to ensure a high-quality dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations to explore key trends and patterns in the data, focusing on factors that may influence insurance charges (e.g., age, BMI, smoking status).

3. **Encoding and Normalization:**
   - Prepare the data by encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features for further analysis and predictive modeling.

### **Dataset Overview:**

The dataset consists of 1,338 records, including the following features:

- **Age:** Age of the individual.
- **Sex:** Gender of the individual (male/female).
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Children:** Number of children or dependents covered by the insurance.
- **Smoker:** Smoking status of the individual (yes/no).
- **Region:** Geographical region (e.g., northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
- **Charges:** Medical insurance costs billed to the individual.

This dataset provides a foundation for analyzing the relationships between customer attributes and insurance charges.

### **Analysis Steps:**

⓵ **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle any missing values (e.g., BMI) and identify potential outliers to ensure data integrity.

⓶ **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Investigate the distribution of variables and identify trends, such as the impact of smoking status on charges or the correlation between age and BMI.

⓷ **Encoding and Normalization:**
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., sex, smoker status, region) and normalize numerical data (e.g., BMI, charges) to prepare for analysis.

⓸ **Answer Key Business Questions:**

   ### **Business Questions:**

   1. How do insurance charges differ between smokers and non-smokers?
   2. Is there a significant difference in charges based on gender?
   3. How does BMI affect the cost of insurance?
   4. Which region has the highest average insurance charges?

### **Required Libraries:**

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib: For data visualization.
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization to explore trends.
- sklearn: For encoding and normalization of features if needed.
